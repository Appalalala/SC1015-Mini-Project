## Problem Statement
According to the World Health Organisation, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives yearly, 32% of global deaths, and 85% were due to heart attacks.
In Singapore, it is reported 11631 heart attack cases per 100k people (7,344 in 2010), averaging 31 a day. Among them, 9.2% died within 30 days.

Up to 80% of premature heart attacks can be prevented with risk management

### We hope to find out how do different factors affect the risk of heart attack among individuals?
