## Source of Dataset
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/heart-attack-prediction-dataset/data) is from Kaggle, by Sourav Banerjee, titled "Heart Attack Risk Prediction Dataset".

## Context
According to the World Health Organisation, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives yearly, 32% of global deaths, and 85% were due to heart attacks.
In Singapore, it is reported 11631 heart attack cases per 100k people (7,344 in 2010), averaging 31 a day. Among them, 9.2% died within 30 days.

Up to 80% of premature heart attacks can be prevented with risk management


## Problem Statement
To find out how do the different factors affect the heart attack risk among individuals


## Data
The following is the factors we will be looking at

## Data Cleaning
### 1. Blood pressure data consists of both systolic blood pressure level and diastolic blood pressure level separated by a /.

We initialise 2 new variables **Systolic_Blood_Pressure** and **Diastolic_Blood_Pressure**.

### 2. We drop these 4 factors
   - **Patient ID** : irrelevant
   - **Country & Hemisphere** : Are better represented by continent to show distribution of the participations
   - **Blood Pressure** : Split into Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure earlier

### 3. Remove Outliers
   - It helps to improve the performance of the model

### 4. Ensure that our data is non-null

## Categorising Variables into 4 Categories
   - This helps when trying to capture non-linear relationships between variables and the target variable like in this case.

## Heat Maps that show Correlation
   - This shows which variables are related to the risk of having Heart Attack

## Variables Chosen from Each Category
   - From each category of variables, we picked the variable with the highest correlation to Heart Attack Risk to be used in our Machine Learning Model to predict Heart Attack Risk

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### 1. Income Level
People with **higher** Income Level tend to have a **lower** Heart Attack Risk

<img src="https://github.com/harikrishnan-vinod/SC1015-Mini-Project/assets/161003075/542909d0-089d-45aa-971a-2b38ee0facbb" width="600">

### 2. Systolic Blood Pressure
**Higher** Systolic Blood Pressure points to a **higher** Heart Attack Risk

### 3. Cholesterol
**Higher** cholesterol tends to lead to a **higher** Heart Attack Risk

### 4. Medication Use
Despite having the highest correlation value under Medical History sub-categorical group, Medication Use **does not affect** Heart Attack Risk

## Our Mission
To accurately classify the Heart Attack Risk (0 or 1) of an individual based on these factors using Machine Learning 

## Machine Learning Models
We decided to use these 4 machine learning models to be able to predict Heart Attack Risk based on the factors of Income, Systolic Blood Pressure, Cholesterol and Medication Use which are our predictor variables. We did that by first splitting the train and test data randomly in a **70/30** split respectively and then using these models to learn from our train data and to see if it would be able to accurately predict our test data.

## 1.Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a **machine learning model** that describes the relationship between a dependent variable,y which in this case is the Heart Attack Risk, and one or more independent variables, which are our factors. The goal is to find the best-fitting linear line that minimises the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values.
 The line is described by the equation:
   - ùë¶ =ùëöùë•+c

### Findings for Linear Regression
The **negative explained variance** told us that the Linear Regression model fits the data very badly. We found out that the linear regression model is not an accurate model to represent Heart Attack Risk which takes on a **binary value** of 0 or 1. This is because Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable and as such is unable to capture the **non-linear relationships** between predictor variables and the binary outcome. 


## 2.Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression Model in which a **logistic function** is used to model the relationships between predictor variables and the binary response variable. The model would then estimate the coefficients of the model that maximises the probability of the observed data

### Multi-Variate Logistic Regression
**Multivariate regressions enables us to capture more complex relationships and interactions among variables that may not be apparent when considering only one predictor variable at a time.**
We then proceeded to do a Multivariate Logistic Regression Model where all the predictor variables were used together to predict Heart Attack Risk.

## 3. Random Forest Machine Learning
Random Forest is like a group decision-making team in machine learning. It combines the opinions of many ‚Äú decision trees‚Äù. It then takes these many decision trees and combines them to avoid overfitting which would then produce more accurate predictions. We included it because it can handle noisy data and is efficient with large datasets. It is a method that has been successfully used in many different fields of research and is definitely a popular ML algorithm in health care.

   ## We realized that the True and False, negative and positive rates are undesirable and that data is imbalanced. Adjusted the data.
