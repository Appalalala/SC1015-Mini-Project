## Source of Dataset
The dataset is from Kaggle, by Sourav Banerjee, titled "Heart Attack Risk Prediction Dataset".

## Context
According to the World Health Organisation, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives yearly, 32% of global deaths, and 85% were due to heart attacks.
In Singapore, it is reported 11631 heart attack cases per 100k people (7,344 in 2010), averaging 31 a day. Among them, 9.2% died within 30 days.

Up to 80% of premature heart attacks can be prevented with risk management


## Problem Statement
To find out how do the different factors affect the heart attack risk among individuals


## Data
The following is the factors we will be looking at

## Data Cleaning
1. Blood pressure data consists of both systolic blood pressure level and diastolic blood pressure level separated by a /.
We initialise 2 new variables Systolic_Blood_Pressure and Diastolic_Blood_Pressure.
